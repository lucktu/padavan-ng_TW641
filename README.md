# Padavan 3.4 - The "Dave Täht Tribute" Edition

> **"When you miss Dave, modprobe sch_cake!"**

## 🕊️ In Loving Memory of Dave Täht

### **🇹🇼：他的心願，我來實現 (Tā de xīn yuàn, wǒ lái shí xiàn)**
### **🇺🇸：His wish, I finished.**
*(A Linux Pun: In our world, a wish ending in **.sh** is a command to be executed!)*

---

### **"穿越時空的夢想，我來幫他實現！"**
**(Making a time-traveling dream come true!)**

### 🎇 The Spirit of the Code: "Fireworks in the Dark"

**"一支穿雲箭，千軍萬馬來相見"**
*(One arrow pierces the clouds, and ten thousand troops come to meet.)*

This Chinese idiom describes a signal so powerful it rallies everyone.
**Dave was that arrow.**
Just like fireworks are most mesmerizing in the darkest night, Dave shone brightest when fighting the invisible enemy of Bufferbloat.

* **"The darker the night, the brighter the light."**
* He worked tirelessly in the dead of night (just as we often do) to **tame the network chaos.**
* Now, "Ten Thousand" (萬) legacy devices are rallying to his call.

### 🏹 The "Archer" Coincidence: A Destiny Revealed

While digging through Dave's old blog posts and presentations, I found a chilling coincidence that proves this project was meant to be.

**1. The "Archer" & The Arrow**
The router series I ported this to is named **"Archer"** (TP-Link). An Archer shoots an **Arrow**.
This perfectly matches our tribute slogan: **"一支穿雲箭 (One Cloud-Piercing Arrow)"**.

**2. The C7 Origin**
In the original 2015 "Cake" presentation at Battlemesh v8, Dave and Jonathan Morton used a **TP-Link Archer C7** to demonstrate that CAKE could shape traffic at 115Mbps while HTB failed.
> *"HTB can’t shape at 115Mbps. Cake can."* — *Battlemesh v8 (2015)*

**3. The C2 Connection**
In his 2016 blog post *"Finally... the real net-next 4.8 fq_codel results"*, Dave wrote:
> *"I pulled the **odroid C2** out, and made it the test driver..."*
Today, we have successfully ported his work to the **TP-Link Archer C2**.

**Dave was the Archer. The Code is the Arrow.**

### ⭐ Light up the Dark: A Final Tribute

**"The darker the night, the brighter the light."**

Did you know? Dave's surname **"Täht"** literally means **"Star"** in Estonian.

If this project helps you, or if you simply want to honor his legacy, please **Light up the "Star"** in the top-right corner of this repository.

Let's keep his Star shining bright in the open-source world, guiding packets through the dark.

We are fulfilling a specific wish he made 5 years ago on Reddit:

### ❝ Help port the code to more chipsets. ❞

> **The BEST engineering result I ever had:**
> Essentially the summation of my 16+ years of work to that point on making wifi better. Unpatented. Please share and enjoy.
> **Help port the code to more chipsets.**
>
> — *Dave Täht (Reddit, 5 years ago)*

*Original Source:* [Reddit - r/Starlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/okmx3x/comment/h61unnn/)

Dave turned down numerous lucrative contracts to keep his code **Free and Open Source**. He valued global impact over prestige. Because of him, millions of devices—from Starlink satellites to rural ISP routers—deliver smoother connectivity.

### **🇹🇼：靈魂永駐，精神長存**
### **🇺🇸：May his soul find eternal peace, and his spirit live on forever in our routers.**

## 🌟 Project Philosophy: Open & Accessible

### **「永遠保持開放且開源的精神」**
**(Forever maintaining an open and open-source spirit)**

This repository is based on the stable `padavan-ng` with **Linux 3.4 kernel**. We believe in giving power back to the user while honoring the giants who paved the way.

1.  **CAKE Integration**: By default, we aim to support the `sch_cake` module (backported to 3.4) to honor Dave's legacy.
2.  **Easy Multi-Model Support**: Support for a massive range of legacy devices, keeping them alive and fast.
3.  **Flexible Language System**:
    * **English Base**: The firmware defaults to a clean, English-only interface.
    * **Custom Language Packs**: You can select *one* additional language (Traditional Chinese, Russian, etc.) during the build process to keep the firmware lightweight yet localized.

## 🗣️ Tributes from the Community

> "Dave’s impact on society was immense... He wanted, ultimately, to speed up the internet so that a drummer in London could play in real-time with a guitarist in Los Angeles."
> — **Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols**

> "I will miss him but will be always grateful to have known him."
> — **Vint Cerf**

> "Without him, Netflix and similar services might still be plagued by glitches and stutters."
> — **Eric S. Raymond**
