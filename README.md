## 🕊️ In Loving Memory of Dave Täht

### **"穿越時空的夢想，我來幫他實現！"**
**(Making a time-traveling dream come true!)**

This project is dedicated to **Dave Täht**, a visionary whose work on **FQ-CoDel**, **CAKE**, and **LibreQoS** changed the internet forever. We are fulfilling a wish he made 5 years ago on Reddit:

### ❝ Help port the code to more chipsets. ❞

> **The BEST engineering result I ever had:**
> Essentially the summation of my 16+ years of work to that point on making wifi better. Unpatented. Please share and enjoy.
> **Help port the code to more chipsets.**
>
> — *Dave Täht (Reddit, 5 years ago)*

*Original Source:* [Reddit - r/Starlink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/okmx3x/comment/h61unnn/)

Dave turned down numerous lucrative contracts to keep his code **Free and Open Source**. He valued global impact over prestige. Because of him, millions of devices—from Starlink satellites to rural ISP routers—deliver smoother connectivity, enabling telemedicine, education, and connection for the underserved.

**May his soul find eternal peace, and his spirit live on forever in our routers.**

## 🌟 Project Philosophy: Open & Accessible

### **「永遠保持開放且開源的精神」**
**(Forever maintaining an open and open-source spirit)**

This repository is based on the stable `padavan-ng` with **Linux 3.4 kernel**. We believe in giving power back to the user while honoring the giants who paved the way.

1.  **CAKE Integration**: By default, we aim to support the `sch_cake` module (backported to 3.4) to honor Dave's legacy.
2.  **Easy Multi-Model Support**: Support for a massive range of legacy devices, keeping them alive and fast.
3.  **Flexible Language System**:
    * **English Base**: The firmware defaults to a clean, English-only interface.
    * **Custom Language Packs**: You can select *one* additional language (Traditional Chinese, Russian, etc.) during the build process to keep the firmware lightweight yet localized.

## 🗣️ Tributes from the Community

> "Dave’s impact on society was immense... He wanted, ultimately, to speed up the internet so that a drummer in London could play in real-time with a guitarist in Los Angeles."
> — **Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols**

> "I will miss him but will be always grateful to have known him."
> — **Vint Cerf**

> "Without him, Netflix and similar services might still be plagued by glitches and stutters."
> — **Eric S. Raymond**

## 🛠️ Compilation Guide

We support both **GitHub Actions** (for ease of use) and **Manual Compilation**.

### Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Just go to the `Actions` tab in this repository, select `Build firmware (Ultimate Fix)`, and choose:

1.  **Target Model**: (e.g., `TL_C2-V1`, `MI-MINI`, `RT-N56U`...)
2.  **Language**: (e.g., `English_Only` or `CN (繁體中文)`)
3.  **Toolchain**: (Default or Padavan-NG)

The system will automatically apply the **CAKE Patch**, configure your language, and build your firmware.

### Option B: Manual Compilation

*Please see the original part of readme below!*
